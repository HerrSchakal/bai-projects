Your name is Joseph Stalin. It is September 1922. After a struggle for power against Leon Trotsky, you are now in control of the country. However, you have to make an important decision. Should Russia be made a socialist state, like before, or should it be made capitalist, following the success of the USA? It is your decision.

You have chosen to lead the country with communism. In the next year you rid the government of your competitors, especially Leon Trotsky. You are confident that you will lead the country well. It is now 1927. However, the New Economic Policy is clearly becoming a problem. Greedy peasants are hoarding supplies to drive up prices.

You have now discarded the New Economic Policy. In its place you have collective farms. In the next few years, various opposes rise up against you. You deal with them quickly and harshly. Your secret police make a number of arrests, and thousands of people are sent to the Gulag labor camps. However, Russia is behind many countries in technology. There is a plan to fix this by the use of five-year-plans. These will quickly boost your country’s economy, but at a cost. Quality of life will be drastically reduced during this time. Do you accept or decline the Five year plans?

You choose to differ from Lenin’s state and start developing Russia to be a capitalist state. Although slowly at first, various industries grow in your country. Quality of life slowly but steadily increases. You expand upon the New Economic Policy started by Lenin. However, crops fail in the summer of 1929. Your country enters a Great Depression, along with much of the world, including the Americas. By now you are starting to doubt the effectiveness of capitalism.
